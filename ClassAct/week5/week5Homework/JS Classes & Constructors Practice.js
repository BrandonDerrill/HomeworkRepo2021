//For example: Perhaps you are creating a web store that sells video games and game consoles.

 You could create a general Item class to hold properties that any 
and every item for sale shares in common, like id, name, or price.

Then, extend Item with a class for GameConsoles and a class for 
VideoGames and include properties specific to each category of item.
